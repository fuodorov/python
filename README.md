# Python Numpy Tutorial

Python is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib and holoviews) it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing.

We expect that many of you will have some experience with Python and Numpy; for the rest of you, this section will serve as a quick crash course both on the Python programming language and on the use of Python for scientific computing.
